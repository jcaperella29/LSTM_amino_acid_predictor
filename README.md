# LSTM_amino_acid_predictor
# Amino Acid Prediction with LSTM

This project demonstrates the use of an LSTM model to predict the next amino acid in a synthetic peptide sequence. The project showcases fundamental bioinformatics and deep learning techniques, including synthetic data generation, one-hot encoding, LSTM sequence modeling, and model evaluation.

## Project Overview

1. **Synthetic Data Generation**: Generates short synthetic peptide sequences of variable lengths (10-30 amino acids) using the 20 standard amino acids.
2. **LSTM Model**: Trains an LSTM model to predict the next amino acid in a sequence based on a specified sequence length.
3. **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluates the model with metrics like AUC, sensitivity, and specificity for each amino acid.
4. **Visualization**: Interactive visualizations using Plotly to analyze the model's performance across amino acids.
